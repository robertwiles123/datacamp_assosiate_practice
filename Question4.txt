There does not seem to be any real corolation between the number of reviews and the ratings resturants got. 
Between around 3.9 and 4.6 have similar levels of reviews, except a dip that happens around 4.3. After 4.6 there are less reviews, meaning that the highest rated seem to have less reviews.
If the line is looked at purely between 4.2 and 4.7 it does seem that as reviews increase so does rating, but only for this small area.
