Write the code for this, import the models then do the comparison, take it from both Q6 and Q7

Linear regression (lr) scores: 
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 46332721.24360673
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2901.1817114302457
R-squared (R2): -80.19381377029863

Random decision tree (RDT) scores:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 443935.6016949515
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 430.1024705234101
R-squared (R2): 0.22204386872702753

MSE:
The RDT scored siginificatly lower then that of the lr model implying that the average errors in predictions is far lower withing the RDT

MAE:
Again is far lower in the RDT meaning that the absolute errors is much lower here. This means that the RDT is getting closer to the real values by a large margin

R2:
The lr get a negative score which means it is unable to make any accurate predictions. While the RDT got accurate scores the score of 0.22204 is not partically good only making accurate predictions around 22.2% of the time
