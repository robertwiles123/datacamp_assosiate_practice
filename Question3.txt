The number of reviews is heavily right skewed, there seems to be a single piece of data that is at 17937 which is far behind the next highest of 202. 
I then recompleted the distribution removing the potential error, this gives a much easier to read distribution.
The distribution is still left skewed with most being under 500 reviews, though there are many that are higher then this.
