To replace the msising I created a dictonary with the key value pairs matching the name of the column and the type of fill for example for rating 0 and for Dine in option False,
this had the added benifit of changing the Dtype to bool as it should be. For reviews I used np.nanmedian to calculate the mediun while excluding the nan data.
